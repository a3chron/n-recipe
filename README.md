# n-recipe

A offline recipe book in a Nothing style

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome, just create a fork, try to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(for the branch naming too, e.g. "feat/add-some-feature"), and create a PR in the end.

## Future Plans

If I suprisingly get the time to work on this enough, and it gains some traction, I might create a paid pro version of the app with some extra features,
but it's important for me that in this case the open-source variant stays useable and active.

I also plan on potentially bringing this to a web app, so it is possible to use it from desktop and mobile app, and sync between.
But it'll stay local first, i.e. it will always work offline, and you can optionally sync once you're online, to use recipes on other devices too.

## Step 1: Start Metro

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using pnpm TODO:
pnpm start

# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using pnpm TODO:
pnpm run android

# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio.
