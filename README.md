# n-recipe

A offline recipe book (maybe will be in a Nothing style).
This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

# Future Plans

If I suprisingly get the time to work on this enough, and it gains some traction, I might create a paid pro version of the app with some extra features,
but it's important for me that in this case the open-source variant stays useable and active.

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome, just create a fork, try to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(for the branch naming too, e.g. "feat/add-some-feature"), and create a PR in the end.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   pnpm expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
