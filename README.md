# n-recipe
A offline recipe book in a Nothing style

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, just create a fork, try to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) 
(for the branch naming too, e.g. "feat/add-some-feature"), and create a PR in the end.

## Future Plans

If I suprisingly get the time to work on this enough, and it gains some traction, I might create a paid pro version of the app with some extra features,
but it's important for me that in this case the open-source variant stays useable and active.
